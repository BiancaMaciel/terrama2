TerraMA2 is built on top of TerraLib, a free and open source library for building GIS enabled applications. Make sure to have at least TerraLib version 5.1.0. You can download it from: http://www.dpi.inpe.br/terralib5.


Bash script for building all dependencies on Linux Ubuntu 14.04
----------------------------------------------------------------

We have prepared a special bash script for this purpose on Linux Ubuntu 14.04. This script can be found in TerraMA2 source tree under https://github.com/TerraMA2/terrama2/tree/master/install/install-3rdparty-linux-ubuntu-14.04.sh.

Follow the steps below:
- Download the third-party libraries package used by the development: http://www.dpi.inpe.br/terrama2-devel/terrama2-3rdparty-linux-ubuntu-14.04.tar.gz.

- Copy the script install-3rdparty-linux-ubuntu-14.04.sh to the same folder you have downloaded the terrama2-3rdparty-linux-ubuntu-14.04.tar.gz.

- Open the shell command line and call the script install-3rdparty-linux-ubuntu-14.04.sh setting the target to install all the stuffs from these third-party libraries and tools:
  $ TERRAMA2_DEPENDENCIES_DIR="/home/user/mylibs" ./install-3rdparty-linux-ubuntu-14.04.sh

(!!Under Development!!)

For Microsoft Visual C++ users we have prepared a zip file containing all the third-party libraries in a binary format. You can download this package from: http://www.dpi.inpe.br/terrama2-devel.

In that folder you will find:
  - terrama2-3rdparty-msvc-2013-win64.zip: all the third-party libraries for building a 64-bit version of TerraMA2 with Qt 5.4.1 support.
  - terrama2-3rdparty-msvc-2013-win32.zip: all the third-party libraries for building a 32-bit version of TerraMA2 with Qt 5.4.1 support.

Windows users that downloaded the auxiliary package (in the TerraMA2 site) must install Qt 5.4.1.
