  TerraMA2 - Dependencies
  =======================

If you want to build yourself TerraMA2 then you need to install some third-party libraries.

For Microsoft Visual C++ users we have prepared a zip file containing all the third-party libraries in a binary format. You can download this package from:
http://www.dpi.inpe.br/terrama2-devel

In that folder you will find:
  - terrama2-3rdparty-msvc-2013-win64.zip: all the third-party libraries for building a 64-bit version of TerraMA2 with Qt 5.4.1 support.
  - terrama2-3rdparty-msvc-2013-win32.zip: all the third-party libraries for building a 32-bit version of TerraMA2 with Qt 5.4.1 support.

Below is a list of third-party libraries dependencies and its versions.

1. TerraLib (Mandatory)
-----------------------

TerraMA2 is built on top of TerraLib, a free and open source library for building GIS enabled applications.

2. Boost (Mandatory)
--------------------

TerraMA2 is built on top of Boost libraries. You will need to have them installed in order to build TerraMA2.
