#  GSOAP_INCLUDE_DIR           - where to find stdsoap2.h.
#  GSOAP_IMPORT_DIR              where to find axiliary headers to gSOAP
#  GSOAP_CPP_LIBRARY           - the gsoap++ library link.
#  GSOAP_SOAPCPP2_EXECUTABLE   - the soapcpp2 application.
#  GSOAP_FOUND                 - True if gSOAP found.
