# TerraMA²

**NOTE:**
* **Until we reach version 4.0.0 this codebase will be instable and not fully operational.**
* **TerraMA² is under active development. We are preparing this site to host it!**
* **If you want to try the old version, please, look at http://www.dpi.inpe.br/terrama2.**

TerraMA² is a free and open source computational platform for early warning systems.

You can build applications to monitor, analyze and issue early warnings related to air quality, water quality, pipelines, tailings dams for mining, forest fires, landslides and debris-mud flows, floods and droughts.

Through a service-oriented architecture, TerraMA² can integrates geospatial data from different web services.

It takes advantage of the datasets available on the Internet to have access to real-time geo-environmental data (meteorological, climatic, atmospheric, hydrological, geotechnical and socio-demographic).

Besides that, it provides support for building models to several application domains through scriptable languages.

The computational platform is based on a service-oriented architecture, which is open and provides the technological infrastructure required to develop and implement operating systems to monitor early warnings of environmental risks.

### Bash Scripts for Building All Dependencies on Linux Ubuntu 14.04

We have prepared a special bash script for this purpose on Linux Ubuntu 14.04. This script can be found in TerraMA² source tree under **[https://github.com/TerraMA2/terrama2/tree/master/install/install-3rdparty-linux-ubuntu-14.04.sh]**. Follow the steps below:

- Download the third-party libraries package used by the development: [terrama2-third-party-linux-ubuntu-14.04.tar.gz](http://www.dpi.inpe.br/terrama2-devel/terrama2-third-party-linux-ubuntu-14.04.tar.gz).

- Copy the script [install-3rdparty-linux-ubuntu-14.04.sh](https://github.com/TerraMA2/terrama2/tree/master/install/install-3rdparty-linux-ubuntu-14.04.sh) to the same folder you have downloaded the [terrama2-third-party-linux-ubuntu-14.04.tar.gz](http://www.dpi.inpe.br/terrama2-devel/terrama2-third-party-linux-ubuntu-14.04.tar.gz).

- Open the shell command line and call the script *install-3rdparty-linux-ubuntu-14.04.sh* setting the target to install all the stuffs from these third-party libraries and tools:
```
$ TERRAMA2_DEPENDENCIES_DIR="/home/user/mylibs" ./install-3rdparty-linux-ubuntu-14.04.sh
```

### Prepared Dependencies for Microsot Windows

**NOT AVAILABLE YET**

For Microsoft Visual C++ users we have prepared a zip file containing all the third-party libraries in a binary format. You can download this package from http://www.dpi.inpe.br/terrama2-devel. In that folder you will find:
- **terrama2-3rdparty-msvc-2013-win64.zip:** all the third-party libraries for building a 64-bit version of TerraMA2 with Qt 5.4.1 support.
- **terrama2-3rdparty-msvc-2013-win32.zip:** all the third-party libraries for building a 32-bit version of TerraMA2 with Qt 5.4.1 support.

Microsoft Windows users that had downloaded the auxiliary package (in the TerraMA² site) must install Qt 5.4.1.


## Cloning TerraMA² Repository

- Open the shell command line.

- Make a new folder to host TerraMA² source code:
```
$ mkdir -p /home/user/mydevel/terrama2/codebase
```

- Change teh current directory to that new folder:
```
$ cd /home/user/mydevel/terrama2/codebase
```

- Make a local copy of TerraMA² repository:
```
$ git clone https://github.com/terrama2/terrama2.git .
```

## Branches
You can check all branches available (remotes and local) and see the current one (marked with "*"):

`$ git branch -a`

The output of above command will be something like:
```
  * master
  remotes/origin/HEAD -> origin/master
  remotes/origin/master
```

In the above output the "* master" means that the current branch is master.

We have the following branches:
- **master:** This is the branch where the development team is working to add new features to future versions of TerraMA². It may be instable although the codebase is subject to automatic tests (regression and unittests). We don't recommend to generate production versions of TerraMA² from this branch. Use it for testing new features and get involved with TerraMA² development.

- **b-4.0.0-alpha:** This will be the first branch in TerraMA²'s codebase for the generation 4.

To switch to one of the branches listed above, use the checkout command and create a local branch to track the remote branch. The syntax of "git checkout" is:

`$ git checkout -b <local_branch_name> <remote_branch_name without this part "remotes/">`

In order to switch to branch *b-4.0.0-alpha* you can use the following command:

`$ git checkout -b b-4.0.0-alpha origin/b-4.0.0-alpha`

## Tags

Also there are tags which usually are originated from a release branch. For instance, tag *t-4.0.0-alpha1* will be originated from branch *b-4.0.0-alpha*.

To check all tags available, use:

`$ git tag -l           (list all tag names)`
```
  t-4.0.0-alpha1
  t-4.0.0-alpha2
  t-4.0.0-beta1
  t-4.0.0-rc1
  t-4.0.0
  ...
```

If you want to checkout a specific version given by a tag and create a local branch to work on you can use the following git command:

`$ git checkout -b <local_branch_tag_name> <one_of_tag_name_listed>`

For instance, to checkout *t-4.0.0-alpha1* you can enter the following command:

`$ git checkout -b t-4.0.0-alpha1  t-4.0.0-alpha1`

## Build Instructions

After choosing the right branch or tag to work on, follow the insructions on **DEPENDENCIES** section. Make sure you have all the third-party library dependencies listed in this section before trying to build TerraMA².

The `build/cmake` folder contains a CMake project for building TerraMA².

Until now its build has been tested on:
- Linux Ubuntu 14.04
- Mac OS X Yosemite
- Microsoft Windows 7.

You should use at least CMake version 2.8.12 for building TerraMA². Older versions than this may not work properly.

Follow the build steps below according to your platform.

### Building on Linux with GNU G++

1.1. Open a Command Prompt (Shell).

1.2. We will assume that the codebase (all the source tree) is located at:

`/home/user/mydevel/terrama2/codebase`

1.3. Create a folder out of the TerraMA² source tree to generate the build system, for example:
```
$ cd /home/user/terrama2
$ mkdir build-release
$ cd build-release
```

1.4. For Linux systems you must choose the build configuration:
```
$ cmake -G "Unix Makefiles" -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE:STRING="Release" -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX:PATH="/home/user/myinstall/terrama2" -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH:PATH="/home/user/mylibs;/usr/local;/opt/external-libraries" ../codebase/build/cmake
```

Notes:
* Some Linux flavours with different versions of GNU gcc and Boost will need more parameters such as:
```
  -DCMAKE_INCLUDE_PATH:PATH="/usr/local;/opt/include"
  -DCMAKE_LIBRARY_PATH:PATH="/usr/local;/opt/lib"
  -DCMAKE_PROGRAM_PATH:PATH="/usr/local/bin;/opt/bin"
  -DBOOST_ROOT:PATH="/opt/boost"
```
* Boost can also be indicated by BOOST_INCLUDEDIR (note: without an '_' separating INCLUDE and DIR):
```
  -DBOOST_INCLUDEDIR:PATH="/usr/local/include"
```
* The parameter -lpthread must be informed only if your Boost was not built as a shared library:
```
  -DCMAKE_CXX_FLAGS:STRING="-lpthread"
```
* For building with Qt5 you can provide the Qt5_DIR variable as:
```
  -DQt5_DIR:PATH="/usr/local/lib/cmake/Qt5"
```
* For generating a debug version set CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE as:
```
  -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE:STRING="Debug"
```
* To turn on C++11 support:
```
  -DCMAKE_CXX_FLAGS:STRING="-std=c++11"
```
* To turn on the check of undefined macros, add the following flag:
```
  -DCMAKE_CXX_FLAGS:STRING="-Wundef"
```
1.5 Building (with 4 process in parallel):

`$ make -j 4`

1.6 Installing:

`$ make install`

1.7 Uninstalling:

`$ make uninstall`

### Quick Notes for Developers

If you have built TerraMA² in Debug mode and you want to run it inside the build tree, you may need to set some environment variables.

For Mac OS X, you can set the following variables:

`$ export DYLD_FALLBACK_LIBRARY_PATH=/Users/user/MyLibs/lib`
`$ export DYLD_FALLBACK_FRAMEWORK_PATH=/Users/user/MyLibs/lib/`
