      \brief Models the information of a DataProvider (or data server).

      A DataProvider can be a remote server that provides data through
      FTP protocol or an OGC Web Service, such as WFS, WCS or SOS.

      It can also be an URI for a folder into the file system.

      A DataProvider contains the list of datasets that belongs to this provider
      that should be collected for further analysis.
