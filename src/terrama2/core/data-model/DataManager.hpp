      \class DataManager

      \brief Manages all the metadata about data providers and dataseries.

      For pratical means, the DataManager is the input of all metadata in a service,
      when new metadata arrives, usually as a JSon, the DataManager instantiate
      the appropriate classes and send signals that will be catch by the services.

      The services should have their own derived DataManager that will handle service
      specific structures and abstractions.

      ## Thread safety ##

      The DataManager is thread safe but some times this is not enough.

      In some cases you need to make a serie of calls from DataManager and
      be sure the state is consistent, for that there is getLock().

      The getLock() will lock the DataManager and return a std::unique_lock,
      it will keep the DataManager locked until released. Because of this it
      should be used with extreme caution.

      ## Order of things ##

      Some things should be kept in mind, dependent classes should be added **after**
      the classes they depend on. Ex.: First add DataSeries, than add DataProvider

      Dependent classes should be removed **before** the classes they depend on.
      Ex.: First remove DataProvider, than remove DataSeries

      This is also true for the services DataManager, when implementing addJSon()
      and removeJSon() keep this in mind.

          \brief Lock the DataManager and returns a lock handle.

          This method is necessary to ensure data consistency when many calls are made.

          When using this method you'll receive a std::unique_lock to the DataManger,
          if using in a small context you'll probably have no problem beacause
          on the destruction of the std::unique_lock the lock is released.

          In the other hand you can release the lock yourself, this is usefull when you have a
          long context or an intensive process, all you need to do is call std::unique_lock::unlock()
          after your use of the DataManger.

          \code{.cpp}
            auto lock = dataManager->getLock();
